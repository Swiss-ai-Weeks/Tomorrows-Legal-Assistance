  <h1>Swiss Employment & Traffic Law — Glossary (Plain)</h1>

  <h2>Employment law</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Termination</dt>
    <dd>Termination describes the unilateral declaration by either the employer or employee to end the employment relationship. It encompasses both ordinary termination with notice and termination during statutory blocking periods. It also covers questions of validity, abusive termination, and the legal consequences of termination.</dd>

    <dt>Ordinary Termination</dt>
    <dd>Ordinary termination refers to the ending of an employment contract with due regard to statutory, contractual, or collective agreement notice periods. It is the standard form of ending employment under Swiss law, unless a justified reason for immediate termination exists.</dd>

    <dt>Notice Period</dt>
    <dd>The notice period is the legally or contractually defined period between the declaration of termination and the effective end of the employment relationship. It ensures both parties have time to prepare for the end of the contract.</dd>

    <dt>Abusive Termination</dt>
    <dd>Abusive termination refers to dismissals given for reasons contrary to good faith, such as discrimination, retaliation, or arbitrariness. While the termination remains effective, the employee may claim compensation of up to six months’ salary.</dd>

    <dt>Blocking Period / Termination at an Inopportune Time</dt>
    <dd>Periods during which termination is legally prohibited, for example during illness or accident-related incapacity for work. Any termination during such periods is null and void. Protection periods depend on the employee’s length of service.</dd>

    <dt>Immediate Termination / Dismissal Without Notice</dt>
    <dd>Immediate termination ends the employment relationship with immediate effect. It is only valid if a “good cause” exists that makes continuation unreasonable, such as serious breaches of duty. If unjustified, the employee is entitled to salary up to the end of the ordinary notice period and potentially additional compensation.</dd>

    <dt>Protest Against Termination</dt>
    <dd>A protest against termination is the written declaration by the employee that a termination is contested as abusive. It is a prerequisite to claim compensation for abusive dismissal.</dd>

    <dt>Wage / Salary</dt>
    <dd>Wages represent the employer’s main obligation under the employment contract. They are the agreed remuneration for work performed. Issues include non-payment of salary, delays, deductions, or claims for overtime pay.</dd>

    <dt>Obligation to Pay Wages During Illness or Accident</dt>
    <dd>Statutory obligation to continue paying wages if the employee is unable to work due to illness or accident through no fault of their own. The duration depends on length of service and cantonal practice (Berner, Zürcher, Basler scale).</dd>

    <dt>Occupational Sick Pay Insurance</dt>
    <dd>Insurance, often taken out by employers, that provides wage replacement (usually 70–80%) during longer absences due to illness. It supplements or replaces statutory wage continuation obligations.</dd>

    <dt>Workload / Employment Level (Pensum)</dt>
    <dd>Pensum denotes the contractual workload expressed as a percentage of a full-time position (e.g., 80%). Employees generally have no legal right to an increase, unless contract, collective agreement, or anti-discrimination provisions apply.</dd>

    <dt>Non-Payment of Salary</dt>
    <dd>Cases where the employer fails to pay wages despite ongoing employment. Employees can enforce claims via debt collection proceedings (Betreibung), through the conciliation authority, or in court.</dd>

    <dt>Breach of Duty of Loyalty / Confidentiality</dt>
    <dd>The employee must safeguard the employer’s legitimate interests and keep business secrets confidential. Violations, such as disclosure of trade secrets, may justify immediate termination.</dd>

    <dt>Conciliation Authority</dt>
    <dd>The conciliation authority is the mandatory first instance in Swiss employment disputes. It seeks an amicable settlement and issues a permit to proceed to court if no agreement is reached.</dd>

    <dt>Labour Court</dt>
    <dd>The labour court is the judicial instance where employment disputes are litigated if conciliation fails. Depending on the canton, proceedings may be free of charge up to a certain dispute value (often CHF 30,000).</dd>

    <dt>Debt Collection (Betreibung)</dt>
    <dd>A state procedure for enforcing monetary claims, initiated at the debt collection office of the debtor’s domicile or seat. It can be used to claim unpaid wages.</dd>

    <dt>Insolvency Compensation</dt>
    <dd>A benefit from unemployment insurance covering unpaid wages if the employer becomes insolvent. It ensures employees receive part of their outstanding salary claims despite bankruptcy.</dd>

    <dt>Discrimination</dt>
    <dd>Unlawful unequal treatment on the basis of sex, including pregnancy or family status, under the Gender Equality Act (GlG). Covers discrimination in pay, promotion, working conditions, and termination.</dd>

    <dt>Collective Employment Contract</dt>
    <dd>A contract concluded between employers or employer associations and employee organisations. It regulates minimum employment conditions such as wages, working hours, or termination procedures, applicable to groups of employees.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Traffic law</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Road Traffic Law</dt>
    <dd>Road traffic law encompasses all legal provisions governing road use, driving, vehicles, and traffic safety in Switzerland. It includes the Road Traffic Act (SVG), the Road Traffic Regulations (VRV), the Traffic Admission Ordinance (VZV), and related provisions in the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code.</dd>

    <dt>Traffic Offence</dt>

    <dt>Speeding</dt>
    <dd>Exceeding the statutory maximum speed limit. Minor: slight excess, handled as an Ordnungsbusse. Severe: higher excess, treated as a misdemeanour or felony (Art. 90 SVG), possibly leading to licence withdrawal and criminal sanctions.</dd>

    <dt>Licence Withdrawal</dt>
    <dd>Administrative measure by the cantonal road traffic office, temporarily revoking the right to drive. May be ordered after serious traffic violations, repeated offences, or medical unsuitability. Duration depends on severity, previous offences, and individual circumstances.</dd>

    <dt>Administrative Warning</dt>
    <dd>Instead of a licence withdrawal, a written warning may be issued for less serious infractions.</dd>

    <dt>Alcohol Limit</dt>
    <dd>Legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers: 0.5‰ for most drivers. 0.1‰ for new drivers in probation, professional drivers, and bus/taxi drivers. Exceeding the limit constitutes a violation with administrative and/or criminal consequences.</dd>

    <dt>Drunk Driving</dt>
    <dd>Operating a motor vehicle with BAC above the legal threshold. Administrative consequences: licence withdrawal, traffic medical assessment. Criminal consequences: fine or custodial sentence. Insurance consequences: possible reduction or refusal of benefits.</dd>

    <dt>Drug Driving</dt>
    <dd>Driving under the influence of illegal drugs or impairing medication. Considered a serious traffic offence with strict sanctions.</dd>

    <dt>Traffic Medical Examination</dt>

    <dt>Administrative vs. Criminal Proceedings</dt>
    <dd>Administrative: Conducted by cantonal traffic authorities (licence withdrawal, warnings). Criminal: Conducted by public prosecutors/courts (fines, monetary penalties, imprisonment). Both proceedings can run in parallel for the same act.</dd>
