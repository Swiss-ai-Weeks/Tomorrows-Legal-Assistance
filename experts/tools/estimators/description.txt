---Employment law
Termination: Termination describes the unilateral declaration by either the employer or employee to end the employment relationship. It encompasses both ordinary termination with notice and termination during statutory blocking periods. It also covers questions of validity, abusive termination, and the legal consequences of termination.
Ordinary Termination: Ordinary termination refers to the ending of an employment contract with due regard to statutory, contractual, or collective agreement notice periods. It is the standard form of ending employment under Swiss law, unless a justified reason for immediate termination exists.
Notice Period: The notice period is the legally or contractually defined period between the declaration of termination and the effective end of the employment relationship. It ensures both parties have time to prepare for the end of the contract.
Abusive Termination: Abusive termination refers to dismissals given for reasons contrary to good faith, such as discrimination, retaliation, or arbitrariness. While the termination remains effective, the employee may claim compensation of up to six months’ salary.
Blocking Period / Termination at an Inopportune Time: This describes periods during which termination is legally prohibited, for example during illness or accident-related incapacity for work. Any termination during such periods is null and void. Protection periods depend on the employee’s length of service.
Immediate Termination / Dismissal Without Notice: Immediate termination ends the employment relationship with immediate effect. It is only valid if a “good cause” exists that makes continuation unreasonable, such as serious breaches of duty. If unjustified, the employee is entitled to salary up to the end of the ordinary notice period and potentially additional compensation.
Protest Against Termination: A protest against termination is the written declaration by the employee that a termination is contested as abusive. It is a prerequisite to claim compensation for abusive dismissal.
Wage / Salary: Wages represent the employer’s main obligation under the employment contract. They are the agreed remuneration for work performed. Issues include non-payment of salary, delays, deductions, or claims for overtime pay.
Obligation to Pay Wages During Illness or Accident: This refers to the employer’s statutory obligation to continue paying wages if the employee is unable to work due to illness or accident through no fault of their own. The duration depends on length of service and cantonal practice (Berner, Zürcher, Basler scale).
Occupational Sick Pay Insurance: This insurance, often taken out by employers, provides wage replacement (usually 70–80%) during longer absences due to illness. It supplements or replaces statutory wage continuation obligations.
Workload / Employment Level: Pensum denotes the contractual workload expressed as a percentage of a full-time position (e.g., 80%). Employees generally have no legal right to an increase, unless contract, collective agreement, or anti-discrimination provisions apply.
Non-Payment of Salary: This term covers cases where the employer fails to pay wages despite ongoing employment. Employees can enforce claims via debt collection proceedings (Betreibung), through the conciliation authority, or in court.
Breach of Duty of Loyalty / Confidentiality: The employee must safeguard the employer’s legitimate interests and keep business secrets confidential. Violations, such as disclosure of trade secrets, may justify immediate termination.
Conciliation Authority: The conciliation authority is the mandatory first instance in Swiss employment disputes. It seeks an amicable settlement and issues a permit to proceed to court if no agreement is reached.
Labour Court: The labour court is the judicial instance where employment disputes are litigated if conciliation fails. Depending on the canton, proceedings may be free of charge up to a certain dispute value (often CHF 30,000).
Debt Collection: A state procedure for enforcing monetary claims, initiated at the debt collection office of the debtor’s domicile or seat. It can be used to claim unpaid wages.
Insolvency Compensation: A benefit from unemployment insurance covering unpaid wages if the employer becomes insolvent. It ensures employees receive part of their outstanding salary claims despite bankruptcy.
Discrimination: Unlawful unequal treatment on the basis of sex, including pregnancy or family status, under the Gender Equality Act (GlG). Covers discrimination in pay, promotion, working conditions, and termination.
Collective Employment Contract: A contract concluded between employers or employer associations and employee organisations. It regulates minimum employment conditions such as wages, working hours, or termination procedures, applicable to groups of employees.
--- Traffic law
Road Traffic Law: Road traffic law encompasses all legal provisions governing road use, driving, vehicles, and traffic safety in Switzerland. It includes the Road Traffic Act (SVG), the Road Traffic Regulations (VRV), the Traffic Admission Ordinance (VZV), and related provisions in the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code.
Traffic Offence: A violation of road traffic rules that can lead to administrative measures, fines, or criminal sanctions. Ranges from minor offences (parking violations) to serious offences (drunk driving).
Traffic Fine: A fixed fine for minor traffic infractions (e.g., slight speeding, illegal parking), regulated by the Ordnungsbussenverordnung (OBV). No criminal record entry. Cannot be combined with licence withdrawal.
Speeding: Exceeding the statutory maximum speed limit. Minor: slight excess, handled as an Ordnungsbusse. Severe: higher excess, treated as a misdemeanour or felony (Art. 90 SVG), possibly leading to licence withdrawal and criminal sanctions.
Licence Withdrawal: Administrative measure by the cantonal road traffic office, temporarily revoking the right to drive. May be ordered after serious traffic violations, repeated offences, or medical unsuitability. Duration depends on severity, previous offences, and individual circumstances.
Administrative Warning: Instead of a licence withdrawal, a written warning may be issued for less serious infractions.
Alcohol Limit: Legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers: 0.5‰ for most drivers. 0.1‰ for new drivers in probation, professional drivers, and bus/taxi drivers.
Exceeding the limit constitutes a violation with administrative and/or criminal consequences.
Drunk Driving: Operating a motor vehicle with BAC above the legal threshold. Administrative consequences: licence withdrawal, traffic medical assessment. Criminal consequences: fine or custodial sentence. Insurance consequences: possible reduction or refusal of benefits.
Drug Driving: Driving under the influence of illegal drugs or impairing medication. Considered a serious traffic offence with strict sanctions.
Traffic Medical Examination: Expert assessment required when doubts about medical or psychological fitness to drive arise (e.g., after drunk driving). Determines whether a person is fit to hold a licence.
Parking Violation: Stopping or leaving a vehicle in prohibited places or exceeding parking time. Often sanctioned by an Ordnungsbusse. In some cases may lead to higher fines or towing.
Accident: An unintended event involving at least one vehicle in motion, leading to property damage, injury, or death. Obligations: stop immediately, secure the site, provide assistance, inform police if required.
Hit and Run: Leaving the scene of an accident without fulfilling duties of assistance, reporting, or identifying oneself. Considered a criminal offence.
Criminal Order: Simplified criminal procedure in Switzerland, where the public prosecutor issues a written penalty decision (fine, monetary penalty, custodial sentence up to 6 months). Common in traffic offences (e.g., drunk driving).
Administrative vs. Criminal Proceedings: Administrative: Conducted by cantonal traffic authorities (licence withdrawal, warnings). Criminal: Conducted by public prosecutors/courts (fines, monetary penalties, imprisonment).
Both proceedings can run in parallel for the same act.
Minor Offence Procedure: Procedure for minor traffic offences with fixed fines. Simple, fast, no criminal record, no licence measures.
Serious Violation: Traffic behaviour that seriously endangers others. Leads to criminal conviction, significant fines or custodial sentences, and long licence withdrawals.
Recidivism: Repeated traffic offences. Leads to stricter measures, longer licence withdrawal periods, or permanent revocation.
Cantonal Road Traffic Office: Cantonal administrative authority responsible for licences, vehicle registration, and enforcement of administrative measures (licence withdrawal, warnings).
